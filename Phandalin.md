## Points of Interest
### Original Locations
**Barthen's Provisions**: The biggest trading post in Phandalin, which stayed open from sunup to sundown. It was run by a lean and balding, middle-aged man with a kindly manner, Elmar Barthen.

**Edermath Orchard**: An orchard field with the simple cottage of a silver-haired half-elf named Daran Edermath. Daran was a retired marshal in the lands of the Dragon Coast. When he retired, he returned to the Neverwinter region, which was his original home, to grow apples and make cider.  Daran has died and his farm is now operated by Sariah and others in the area that were in need. 

**Lionshield Coster**: A weapons and armor supplier owned by the Lionshield Coster. The master of this post is a sweet older woman named Linene Graywind.

**Phandalin Miner's Exchange**: A trading post where miners had their finds weighed and paid out.  Run by Halia Thornton, who trades more than gems and jewels in the area.  She has many connections and many, many sending stones.

**Shrine of Luck**: A small shrine made of stones from ruins and Phandalin's only temple, dedicated to Tymora.  A curiosity more than anything. 

**The Sleeping Giant**: A rundown establishment that was originally offered to the party during their first stay in Phandalin.  It has been cleaned up and re-opened by Sariah and the people from Daran's orchard.  Sariah has established the Gorunn family here.  

**Stonehill Inn**: A modest inn that is now run by Sariah Halkitt.

**Townmaster's Hall**: A small building that served as the seat of the town government. It also housed a small, but serviceable jail in the cellar.

**Tresendar Manor**: More of a castle than a manor, this was an ancient building that was abandoned after the orc raids of 951 DR. In the late 15th century DR, the cellarsâ€”once served as a safe haven when the estate was attacked. It also served as a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar familyâ€”were turned into the hideout of the Redbrands. 

### New Locations
**Smith** - Local blacksmith Hotath Brocksopp, burly human short on words and intelligence.  People have nicknamed him "Hot" as when visiting him at the forge he states "I'm hot"
