### Fantastic Locations

- [[Thundertree|Thundertree]]
- [[Phandalin]]

- Thundertree will be hot and humid, fabric will stick to sweaty bodies.  Beads of sweat, acrid smell burning noses and eyes.  Ground fog is heavy in the area concealing the ground from view outside of 20ft.  Very quiet, occasionally a rustle of leaves/branches and wind may blow the area swirling fog and chilling the perspiration on the players.  Small animals may be noticed following the party and watching.  Vines and brambles grown over much of the ruins, seem to form a maze.
