## Session Wrapup

The party awoke to find Mirna missing.  Rocky noted a missing horse in the stable as he and Ferrand made their way inside.  Lohse discovered pillows covered with blankets in Mirna's bed, a classic trick!  The party quickly gathered their things to begin their pursuit.  Lohse was able to track Mirna's direction of travel towards Thundertree.  

Upon entering Thundertree, the air grew thick and humid.  The trees and brambles were grown unnaturally close together, restricting movement to the road.  This would create a maze in Thundertree, with no quick way of retreat.  Lohse was able to continue tracking Mirna to a small ruined building.  Inside she found Mirna working on prying up some floorboards.  

Mirna was able to retrieve her alchemy kit.  Lohse looking on saw that the contents of the velvet lined chest were pure white in appearance.  Much different than any of the alchemy equipment she has seen.  She always see Mirna take out a small locket, open it, close it and put it around her neck without much said about it.  

Outside, Lily notices a form shamble out of the wood line.  She approached the form attempting to communicate, she is quickly surrounded and set upon by Ash Zombies.  She is pinned to the ground and bitten.  Rocky springs into action, calling upon Marthammor Duin and destroying the undead in the area.  A bright flash is seen before the zombies crumble into embers and burn away.  

Before the party is able to think about what has happened loud thumps are heard.  The sound of heavy stones hitting the ground and eventually trees and stone buildings in Thundertree.  This sound is mixed with the sounds of heavy wings flapping.  Crashing is heard in the woods all around as if the trees are being pushed over.  The party makes haste to depart but find their way blocked by hill giant after Rocky casts light to assist the humans with seeing in the dark.  The creature steps into the road shortly after the sound of flapping is stopped.  It and the party are consumed in chlorine gas as the green dragon of Thundertree makes a strafing run on their position.  The giant is killed instantly, dissolving as the party recovers.  Much of the party are blinded and the horses are killed, making escape a much harder task.  The sounds of stones and wings carry on around the party as they try to regroup.  Lily makes an attempt to command the dragon to stop, but she is not heard over the cacophony.  The party luckily makes their escape as the dragon continues it's strafing runs on the giants in Thundertree.  

Beaten and tired, the party makes camp for the night.  It will be a full days journey back to Falcon's Nest with the party arriving late at night.  

## Important Things Found and Learned

- Mirna's alchmey kit has been retrieved
	- Dlarna is the material the items are made of (what bonus)
	- The locket contains a picture of her parents (where are they?)
- The party discovered like Falcon said, "Dragons are not orcs."

## Who Did They Meet?

- N/A

## What Worked or Didn't

- I wanted to show that monsters in the world are enemies of each other, just as much as they might be enemies of the players.  Falcon can expand on this next session, that the enemy of your enemy can be your friend without ever a word exchanged.
