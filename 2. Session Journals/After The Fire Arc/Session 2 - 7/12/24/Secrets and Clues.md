Ferrond Brawnstone - Dwarf Cleric of Moradin - hails from Citadel Adbar, looking for ideas for next Shieldmeet - Forge at Everfire  
(A well-guarded route ran through the Underdark from Citadel Adbar to Sundabar and also provided access to the ==Everfire==. Once every four years at ==Shieldmeet==, a dozen master craftsmen were chosen by the king to make the perilous journey to the forge at Everfire. They were each given an entire year to create a single magical weapon or piece of armor commissioned by the king for an undisclosed champion of Citadel Adbar. These priceless artifacts were presented to the most deserving defenders of the city, as chosen by the king, and were almost always dwarves, however at least one dwarf friend had been awarded this great honor.
