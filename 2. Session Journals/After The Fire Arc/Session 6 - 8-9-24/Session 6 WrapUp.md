## What Worked or Didn't

- Slow session of roleplay, we have had a lot of combat through this arc.  This was a chance for party to catch their breathe and discuss things.  
- Party needs to talk to each other about what they've found, as the map is important to Lohse wanting to find Elves and vial is important to dealing with [[Venomfang Statblock|Venomfang]].
