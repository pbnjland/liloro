The party has traveled from Neverwinter to the settlement of Phandalin. Coming across two dead horses in an obvious ambush attempt. The party was able to kill three goblins and identify one of the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker. Deciding not to chase the final goblin survivor, the party pressed on to Phandalin, where they delivered their wagon of supplies to Barthen's Provisions. Elmar, a strange shop keep, paid the party 10 gp each and told them they could find a room at Stonehill Inn down the road. He expressed his concern for Gundren and sent them on their way. Arriving at Stonehill Inn, the group met the young human owner Toblen Stonehill. The party secured lodgings and Rocky Frostbeard learned of a gang in-town that may be stirring up trouble…

Deciding to return to the site of the ambush and pursue a lead there. The party visiting town master, Harbin Wester. They secured horses with promises to help the supply issues in Phandalin. A few hours of travel brought them to a small hillside cave. The party explored the dark cave and dispatched many goblins. Sneaking into a goblin rally, they discovered a goblin leader with a hostage. After his calls for a truce were ignored, the goblin shoved his hostage over the edge of a drop nearly killing him. In his final moments, Mythammor Duins favor was channeled through Rocky, healing him enough for a travel back to town. Before leaving, many supplies for Phandalin were discovered. Leaving an unexplored section of cave the party traveled back to town, arriving just as a storm rolled in. Drenched and exhausted the party returned to Stonehill Inn to find Toblen at the bar. Whirling around with a hand over his eye he exclaimed "I'm glad your back…"
 
3rd Kythorn, 1491 DR
 
The party arriving back at Stonehill Inn find Toblen being extorted. Four Redbrands come downstairs and confront the party, three are killed and placed in the root cellar, one is hobbled and placed in the prison under the Townmaster's Hall. The party decides it's time to deal with the Redbrands, getting information from Pip and Carp about a secret location they sneak in. A strange creature makes a deal with them, the location of Cragmaw Castle for the wizard Glasstaff. The party located and kills Glasstaff and fed his body to the creature.
 
They arrived back in the town square at the same time Sildar was bringing the supply caravan back from Cragmaw Cave. A celebration was had as many missing supplies finally reached their destinations. Lohse lost a gold piece in a completely fair archery contest, but quickly won it back later in the night in the drinking competition. Lily and Rocky spoke with Sildar and learned of several issues in the area. The party met a one-armed paladin named Daran Edermath who owns the orchard in town. During the festivities screams were heard as the three Redbrands from the root cellar came back to life and started looking for something to eat. At the same time, the remaining Redbrands came into town looking for revenge. The party with Toblen were able to kill the zombies and leaving the inn saw Sildar and Darran in combat with two large bugbears. The party jumped into action helping Sildar and Darran dispatch the bugbears while the town residents were able to drive out the rest of the Redbrand threat. Lily and Lohse helped move the wounded to the Shrine of Luck where Rocky was able to administer as much aide as he could. Daran and Sildar took a wagon of bodies out of town to burn so that more bodies would not come back to life. Lily and Lohse went to bed and Toblen shows Rocky a tunnel that had been burrowed through the root cellar that had not been there. After making sure Toblen arrived home safely, Rocky returned to the Inn to go to bed.
