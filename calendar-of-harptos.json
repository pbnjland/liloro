It was the last great festival of the calendar year.</p>\n\n<p>The day traditionally marked the onset of winter. It was also a time to celebrate and honor the ancestors and the respected dead. On this day, folk blessed their ancestors' graves and performed the Ritual of Remembrance. People also gathered to tell stories of the deeds of their ancestors and of the gods until deep into the night, until they merged and became legend.

This meant that most of the fighting usually occurred in the month of Uktar.

Prime among these was to perform the Bloodsong ceremony, at which a Herald publicly recited the genealogies of each noble family in the area. In this way, the Heralds reaffirmed a noble family's traditional authority and status, as well as the respect accorded to them.</p>\n\n<p>Priests of a number of deities of various pantheons held rites, ceremonies, and festivals on the Feast of the Moon.

Traditions varied from community to community, but examples of festive activity included food-related contests; races and challenges of skill and strength; receiving homemade sweets from the local clergy; and priests blessing larders, wine cellars, grain bins, and food preserves.</p>\n\n<p>This day was often an important anniversary to various governments. Often, taxes and tithes came due, rulers held \"open courts\" to hear the concerns of their citizens, oaths were publicly renewed, troops received marching orders to new duty stations, and guilds met to confer on prices and rate changes for goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>According to tradition, dwarves only drank water and elves drank only dew on this day. However, these traditions began to fade in the 14th and 15th century DR.</p>\n\n<p>It was said that children born on this day were favored by Tymora to have lifelong good luck but be smitten with wanderlust. Another legend was that human females born on this day had control over their reproductive system (i.e., got pregnant only when they wanted to) by force of will alone, and that they could instantly sense when they had been poisoned, either by ingestion or being bitten by a venomous creature for example.</p>","event_category_id":"festivals","calendar_id":"calendar-of-harptos","settings":{"color":"Red","text":"text","hide":false,"hide_full":false,"print":false},"created_at":"2024-07-26 01:02:39","updated_at":"2024-07-26 01:02:39","sort_by":6,"creator_id":69184},{"id":2532821,"name":"Greengrass","data":{"has_duration":false,"duration":0,"show_first_last":false,"limited_repeat":false,"limited_repeat_num":0,"conditions":[["Month","0",["5"]],["&&"],["Day","0",["1"]]],"connected_events":[],"date":[],"search_distance":0},"description":"<p>Greengrass was a festival to welcome in the first day of spring in the Calendar of Harptos.
