## Profile
Halfling that has befriended the party.  Originally meeting them in Phandalin after [[Falcon The Hunter|Falcon]] told her about [[Lohse Knoll]], a girl from Thundertree.  Mirna was in town with Falcon as Phandalin was celebrating the recapturing of supplies from the Cragmaw goblin tribe nearby.

Mirna is skilled in alchemy and going unnoticed.  She is aided in this by a very special cloak that keeps her hidden, even in plain sight.  

She wants to return to Thundertree to obtain her alchemy kit and family recipe book, it's all she has left of her parent's.
