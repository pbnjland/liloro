**Quest Hooks**  
-Redbrands killed Sheriff Thel Drendar and his family(Mirna, Nilsa, Nels) is missing. My buddy Carp is sweet on his daughter Nilsa. Nels is good fun to have around too. Me and Carp have been searching everywhere. The Redbrands usually hang out at the Sleeping Giant but I don't know if Carp has found anything new.
 
-Sends party to Edermath Orchard to speak with Daran Edermath, cool, old half-elf that his dad buys mead, ale and cider from. He hates the Redbrands too.
 
-also sends party to Alderleaf Farm to talk to Carp.
