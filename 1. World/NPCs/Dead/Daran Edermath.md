**Old Owl Trouble**. Daran has heard stories  
from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that  
someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old  
Owl Wel!. More disturbingly, several prospectors have  
reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks  
the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march  
northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and  
what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an  
old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as  
Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be  
dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see "Old  
Owl Well" (page 29).
