## Profile

Dwarven cleric of Moradin, from [[Citadel Adbar]].  Ferrand is traveling in preparation for the next Shieldmeet celebration, when a dozen master craftsmen will be selected for the opportunity to journey to the forge at Everfire.  Once there, the craftsmen are given one year to create a single magical weapon or piece of armor commissioned by the king for an undisclosed champion of Citadel Adbar.  

Ferrand must bring a piece worthy of consideration to journey to Everfire.
