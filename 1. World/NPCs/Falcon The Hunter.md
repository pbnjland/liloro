## Profile
Member of the Emerald Enclave, an accomplished hunter and fighter.  Currently manning Falcon's Nest, a hunting lodge used by the Enclave in Neverwinter Wood.  Falcon is by all accounts and appearances human, but he has elven blood.  Not quite half but enough to make a difference.  He takes after his father, Florin Falconhand, that way.
