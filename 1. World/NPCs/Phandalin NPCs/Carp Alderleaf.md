**Quest Hooks**  
He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing  
in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a  
secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits"  
came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with  
a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close.  
Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the  
old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel  
or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel  
leads to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.
