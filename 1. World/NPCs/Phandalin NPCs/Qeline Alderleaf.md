a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that  
goes on in town. Connections

**Quest Hooks**  
**Reidoth the Druid.** Qelline is a longtime friend  
of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the  
characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such  
as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that  
they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since there's not an  
inch of the land he doesn't know." She tells the characters  
that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called  
Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The  
ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and  
she provides directions so the characters can easily find  
the place. If the party pursues this quest, see "Ruins of  
Thundertree" (page 30).
