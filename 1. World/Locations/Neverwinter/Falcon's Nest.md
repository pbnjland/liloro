## Overview
Base of operations for the [[Emerald Enclave]] in Neverwinter Wood.  Currently manned by [[Falcon The Hunter]], used regionally during High Harvesttide to induct new members.  Lodge has been in use for many years, and has had many donors and visitors during it's time.  The banners of nobility that hang throughout the lodge were once considered friends of the Enclave...some still are.  There are also several designs dedicated to the [[Seven Sisters]] hidden throughout the lodge.  These hint at the identity of it's current master.
