**Waterdeep**, also known asÂ **the City of Splendors**Â or theÂ **Crown of the North**,[[11]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep#cite_note-CoS.CG-p27-13)Â was the most important and influential city inÂ [the North](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Northwest_Faer%C3%BBn)Â and perhaps in allÂ [FaerÃ»n](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn). It was a truly marvelous cosmopolitan city of great culture that attracted the most talented artisans, artists, and scholars from across the Realms, as well as a commercial hub for financial interests along the coast and beyond.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep#cite_note-FRCS-p178-180-1)[[12]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep#cite_note-CoS.W-p13-14)  
It was one of if not the most powerful and influential member-states of theÂ [Lords' Alliance](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lords%27_Alliance), the coalition of nations and city-states that sought to maintain order along theÂ [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast)Â and the North.[[13]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep#cite_note-W.DH-p16-15)
 > From <[https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep)>  

Waterdeep was ruled by a sixteen-seat council whose membership was largely secret. These hidden Lords of Waterdeep maintained their identities behind magical masks, called theÂ _Lord's Helm_, and while they ruled in public, none knew the true identities of most of them. The subject of who the Lords were became a common topic of noble conversation, and some considered it a game to discover the Lords' identities, a game made more confusing by the fact the Lords themselves set their own rumors afloat.==[1]==
