A decent sized farm on the edge of town. There are several buildings  
around the property. They appear to be holding various farm imtplements.  
If there is a knock on the door, [Qeline](Qeline%20Alderleaf.md) does not come to answer, she is in  
town visiting friends. [Carp](Carp%20Alderleaf.md) calls to the party from around the side of the house.
 
A wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is  
a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that  
goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the  
characters stay in her hayloft if they don't want to stay at  
the Stonehill Inn.
 
**Carp's Story.** Qelline's son, Carp, is a spirited and  
precocious halfling lad of ten years. He is enchanted by the  
idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing  
in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a  
secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits"  
came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with  
a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close.  
Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the  
old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel  
or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel  
leads to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.
 
**Quest: Reidoth the Druid.** Qelline is a longtime friend  
of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the  
characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such  
as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that  
they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since there's not an  
inch of the land he doesn't know." She tells the characters  
that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called  
Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The  
ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and  
she provides directions so the characters can easily find  
the place. If the party pursues this quest, see "Ruins of  
Thundertree" (page 30).
