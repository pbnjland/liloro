# Overview
Axeholm was a dwarven fortress carved into a mountainside, within the Sword Mountains range in the Sword Coast North. The keep's crest was a dwarven gauntlet holding a handaxe.
It was located in the northern slopes of the mountain, about a day's travel south of Phandalin.

# Interior
The lower halls of Axeholm included an imposing entrance gauntlet that opened up to the great hall, along with a large barracks and numerous guard posts. The dwarven protectors had easy access to their well-stocked armory and smithy. At the rear of the grand hall was the keep's throne room, as well as its dining hall and kitchens.

# History
Long before the 1490s DR, the fortress was infiltrated by an elf named Vyldara. She was apprehended, imprisoned, and eventually killed while trying to escape custody. Risen as a banshee, Vyldara haunted the site of her death, causing the dwarves to abandon their home for other lands.

# Inhabitants
After Axeholm became haunted, a number of ghouls formed their den within within its lower halls.
