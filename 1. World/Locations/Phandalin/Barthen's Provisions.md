# Overview
Barthen's Provisions acted as a general store, and was open from dawn until dusk. It sold low-cost trade wares, such as adventuring gear, as well as rations and other simple goods. However, they did not sell weapons and armor or potions, but Barthen would helpfully direct interested buyers to places where they could find these. For larger orders, Barthen would supply a cart pulled by his ox Vincent to move the goods.

Barthen's Provisions also served as a trading hub. Clerks Ander and Thistle would unload and load carts of goods and resources that came into, or were to go out of, Phandalin via wagon. Barthen also brokered deals for large sales of livestock and similar goods, bringing together local sellers from as far south as Leilon with buyers as far afield as Waterdeep.
