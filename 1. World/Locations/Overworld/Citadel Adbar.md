# Overview
Dwarven stronghold of 20,000 in The Silver Marches, a mere third of the 60,000 that could be homed here.  Not welcoming to outsiders, even other dwarves are only allowed access to the top layers of the citadel.  All goods made in Citadel Adbar are considered masterwork and demanded high prices throughout the north.  Underdark trade routes are accessible through the Caravan Door, linking to Sundabar, Mithral Hall and Mirabar.  The Caravan Door also provided access through the Underdark to the forge at Everfire.

These priceless artifacts were presented to the most deserving defenders of the city, as chosen by the king, and were almost always dwarves, however at least one dwarf friend had been awarded this great honor.

The Foundry - forge in the heart of the Citadel's depths.  Smoke exited out the central tower chimney, looking like a volcano.  
A waterwheel operated in the lowest parts of the mines.
