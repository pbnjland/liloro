<h1> Player Background 

Lee and Lou Stormwind were born in 1430. They met when they both entered the
Lord’s Service in 1448 as teenagers; Lee was a stable boy/ Lou served as a silk
maker (a skill she learned from her mother’s hobby.)
One day, Lee saw a product of Lou’s silk making. He thought she and her work
were beautiful. Their relationship grew from that day forward.
Meanwhile, they both developed close bonds of loyalty with the Lord and his
family. This loyalty earned them the title of Count and Countess of Corlinn Hill in
1452.
Five years later Lily was born (1457) and was only 4 years old when they had to
relocate due to the eruption of Mount Hotenow (1461.)
I am glad to report, my parents, Lee and Lou are alive and well and still live in
Waterdeep.
