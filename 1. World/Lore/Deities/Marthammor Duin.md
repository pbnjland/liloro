# Appearance
==
==
Marthammor was known to appear as a thin dwarf with a dark beard, wearing leather armor and furs along with a cloak of natural colors (typically green).[[7]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marthammor_Duin#cite_note-DD-22-23-7)  
When appearing before dwarves on the [material plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Material_plane) he was known to take the form of either a glowing blue-white disembodied hand, a glowing [mace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mace), or a glowing [magic mouth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_mouth), depending upon the situation. ==

Marthammor's clergy were known as the volamtar ("blazers of fresh trails"). They represented one of the most widely recognized dwarven churches of the surface wide, particularly in the [North](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/North_Faer%C3%BBn). Volamtar marked wilderness trails near dwarven strongholds to make the path of those that might follow from the clanholds easier. They patrolled trade routes and game trails between [human](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human) and dwarven enclaves, healing the injured and clearing these areas of dangerous predators.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marthammor_Duin#cite_note-F&P3e-p120-121-1) They were also known to leave way-caches of food and supplies along these trails.[[7]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marthammor_Duin#cite_note-DD-22-23-7)  
In urban areas, they set up temples with the aim of strengthening dwarven populations through healing, religious ceremonies and exchange of information. Sometimes they attempted to gain minor political positions to influence the government of non-dwarven cities.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marthammor_Duin#cite_note-F&P3e-p120-121-1) ==
