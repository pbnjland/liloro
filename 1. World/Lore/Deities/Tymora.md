# Description
==
==Tymora is the goddess of good fortune. She is the patron of adventurers in general. She shines upon those who take risks and bless those who deal harshly with the followers of Beshaba. Should someone flee from her sister's mischievous followers or defile the dead, their fate is decided with a roll of Tymora's dice.==Â

# Appearance
==
==
Symbol is a silver coin featuring Tymora's face surrounded by shamrocks. When Tymora appears, which is rare, she is a fit female, with long flowing white hair, in a blue robe with silver trim. She has an impish nose and a capricious lock of hair that periodically dances on her forehead. She is always smiling. She appears as whatever race the viewer is (a halfling will see a halfling, while a human sees a human, even if they are standing next to each other). Tymora has been known to take the form of a silver bird or a silver pegasus. She also sends servant creatures to aid mortals in these shapes, as well as those of einheriar, faerie dragons, foo lions, swanmays, and unicorns. When showing her favor for a particularly blessed gambler, she has sometimes been known to manifest as a silver glow about a gambler that is evident only to that person and not those around him or her. When this happens, something favorable will happen in regard to the wager, whether it is the wagerer being more likely to win or even the bets being forced to be called off (in cases where the bet was rigged by the opposition).
