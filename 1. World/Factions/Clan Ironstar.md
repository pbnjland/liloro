# Clan Ironstar 
# Background
The Ironstar dwarves immigrated to [[Mintarn]] island during a very troubled time in their history, at the invitation of the current Tyrant.  They do not possess the land on which they live, but rather they pay an annual tribute(gift) to "His Tyrancy" for that privilege.  This is the only known example of such an arrangement in all of Dwarfdom.  The arrangement was accepted by one segment of the clan, which was at the time scattered and homeless.  It was initially (by the dwarves) thought to be a temporary solution.  

## Governance
### Monarchy
Clan Ironstar, like most dwarven clans, began as a monarchy.  The clan rose to prominence largely due to King Daurvos Frostbeard, who was tragically slain at the Stone Bride in DR 207, while leading the clan in exile of the Fallen Realm.  Until Mintarn, the clan had always had a king or queen.  The purists believe a return to monarchy is necessary.  

### Council of Thanes (patriarchal democracy) - 1480DR
Shortly after arriving on Mintarn, the need for autonomous governance arose.  A new king could not be selected, as the location and disposition of the rest of the clan was not known.  It was decided that one male representative (Thane) from each family present would meet in council to oversee affairs.  After discussion and debate, most issues were agreed upon.  If agreement could not be reached, the eldest thane would decide for the clan.  His word was final. 

### Board of Regents (Government by committee) - Present
One representative, male or female (Regent), was elected for each division of government.  Each regent would then select a committee to administer for each division, which was often composed of subcommittees.  Each family was required to provide at least one committee member to serve on at least one committee.  Most families have multiple members serving on multiple committees.  While very effective, this style of government is highly inefficient. 

## Sociopolitical Classes
### modernists (Regents)
These dwarves think things are fine as is.  The clan has never been wealthier thanks to the Tyrants global contacts and ease of export, and security is provided.  Societal concepts counter to dwarven culture are rationalized away as being roadblocks to the "Better Way."

### separists (Thanes)
These dwarves, while accepting of the benefits of the "Better Way," feel that the ever rising tribute has become a yoke of oppression.  They advocate overthrowing the Tyrant. 

### Purists (Monarchy)
These dwarves believe it is past time to leave Mintarn and re-establish tradition society by reintegrating with relatives on the mainland if possible, by conquest if not. 

## Religion
All dwarves accept that the race was forget by Moradin, and that the pantheon exists. 

### Agnostic
Do not see themselves as "subjects" of the gods, and feel that the gods are largely disinterested in the daily goings-on of individuals and clans.  When they do (rarely) inject themselves on this plane it is almost always for their own purposes, not the betterment of individuals or society.  When an individual's prayer is answered favorably, there is always a "catch."

### Religious
See all their actions as being answerable to tradition and/or the divine, all prayers are heard, most are answered, some are refused.  your best hope for divine intervention is to strictly uphold tradition and adhere to all divine mandates, observe special days, etc.  To minimize the gods or their role is to invite peril.
