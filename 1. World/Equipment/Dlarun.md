# Overview
Dlarun, also known as icesteel, was a non-natural white metal that was unknown to most peoples of Faer√ªn, save for select groups of halflings. The "good folk" were quite secretive about their knowledge of dlarun, often giving misleading descriptions or feigning ignorance if it was ever brought up in conversation.

This lightweight metal was bone white in color with a high polish that shone green when illuminated by candles or magical sources of light. Considering it was a more esoteric substance, it could easily be mistaken for ivory.

# Uses
Confers mild ability to see through illusions when in contact with Dlarun, can also ignore certain psionic effects. 

When used in alchemy equipment greatly reduces crafting time of potions, oils, etc.  Since all recipes and interactions can't be known, sometimes, additional properties can be imbued to the concoction.
